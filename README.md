## HOW THE CODE WORKS
EZ-Bash is structured for clarity and ease of use. When a user enters a command at the prompt, the script checks if it matches any of the supported commands using a case statement for efficient branching. Each command is handled in its own section, clearly labeled with headers explaining its purpose.

If the entered command is recognized, the corresponding code block executes. If not, the script displays an error message indicating the command was not found. All functionality is contained within a single script file to simplify installation and usageâ€”no need to manage multiple files.

The code avoids unnecessary complexity and is beginner-friendly, with no inappropriate language. New contributors are welcome, especially those learning Bash and open source development.
