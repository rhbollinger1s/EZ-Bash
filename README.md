short. If you understand bash and want to help

## HOW THE CODE WORKS
While EZ-Bash doesnt have the best comments, it
is a easy script to learn. The user enters a
command, and we call that a prompt. Then, we run
alot of ifs, 27, one for all english letters. If a
command matches a command we support, it runs the
code inside of the corresponding if statement. If
not, it will echo the ErrorCommandNotFound var.
The code is nicely cut up into chunks, all chunks
have a header telling you what this one does.
We do this so we dont have a billon bash scripts,
everything is in one script. While you don't 
want that most of the time, this script is one
in a millon as we dont want are install to
be hard to do. Why make bash EZ if you need to
be a expert just to install the script. 
Also, one other rule, unlike the linux kernel,
we will have no cuss words in our code. If
somebody just learned bash, and wanted to help
open source, this is the place to do it.
